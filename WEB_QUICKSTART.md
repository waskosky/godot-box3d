# Box3D Web quick start

Godot Web exports can load `godot-box3d` when the extension side module and the Godot Web template are built with matching dynamic-link settings. This repository uses a supported single-threaded profile with Godot 4.7 and Emscripten 4.0.20.

## Fastest route: use a prebuilt Web bundle

Install the normal desktop addon from the latest release first. For a tagged version, download its versioned Web ZIP and `.sha256` checksum from [Releases](https://github.com/bearlikelion/godot-box3d/releases). For development snapshots, download the `godot-box3d-web-release` artifact from a successful **Web build and smoke** workflow run.

The archive contains:

```text
godot-box3d-web/
├── addons/godot-box3d/
│   ├── godot-box3d.gdextension
│   └── bin/web/
└── web-export-templates/
    ├── godot-box3d-web-debug.zip
    └── godot-box3d-web-release.zip
```

`BUILD_MANIFEST.json` records the exact source revision, dependency pins, binaries, templates, and their hashes. The adjacent release checksum verifies the complete downloaded ZIP.

Merge `addons/godot-box3d` into the existing addon in the Godot project. Keep the desktop binaries from the normal release and add the new `bin/web` directory:

```text
your-project/
└── addons/godot-box3d/
    ├── bin/
    │   ├── libgodot-box3d.so, .dylib, or .dll
    │   └── web/
    └── godot-box3d.gdextension
```

Open the project with Godot 4.7 when using the supplied templates. Then:

1. Open **Project Settings → Physics → 3D → Physics Engine**.
2. Select **Box3D Physics** and restart the editor.
3. Create or edit a Web export preset.
4. Enable **Extensions Support** and disable **Thread Support**.
5. Set the custom debug and release templates to the two ZIPs from `web-export-templates/`.
6. Export the project normally.

The equivalent project setting is:

```ini
[physics]

3d/physics_engine="Box3D Physics"
```

## Build the Web bundle from source

Requirements:

- Git and Python 3.
- A C/C++ build toolchain available on Linux or macOS.
- Enough free disk space for Emscripten, Godot source, and build outputs.

From the repository root, run:

```bash
MAX_JOBS=4 scripts/quickstart_web.sh
```

That command installs the pinned local SCons environment, checks out the exact dependency revisions, installs the pinned Emscripten toolchain, builds the debug/release extension modules and matching Godot templates, validates them, and creates:

```text
dist/godot-box3d-web-release.zip
```

The first template build compiles Godot itself and can take a while. Later runs are incremental. Set `MAX_JOBS` to a conservative value if the machine has limited memory.

## Serve an exported project locally

Web exports with extension support should be served over HTTP with cross-origin opener and embedder policies. The included development server adds those headers:

```bash
python3 /path/to/godot-box3d/scripts/serve_web_export.py \
  /path/to/your-project/build/web \
  --port 8060
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8060/>. Do not test by opening `index.html` directly from the filesystem.

## Verify the included smoke project

Point `GODOT_BIN` at a Godot 4.7 executable, then export the release smoke scene:

```bash
GODOT_BIN=/path/to/godot
mkdir -p build/web-smoke-release
mkdir -p web_smoke_project/addons/godot-box3d/bin/web
cp bin/web/*.wasm web_smoke_project/addons/godot-box3d/bin/web/
"$GODOT_BIN" --headless \
  --recovery-mode \
  --path web_smoke_project \
  --export-release "Web Box3D Smoke" \
  ../build/web-smoke-release/index.html
```

For the automated browser assertion:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install playwright
.venv/bin/python -m playwright install chromium
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_web_smoke.py \
  --dir build/web-smoke-release \
  --screenshot build/web-smoke-release.png
```

The test passes only when the extension registers, Box3D is the requested backend, a rigid body settles on the floor, an area callback fires, a hinge moves, and a `SeparationRayShape3D` motion query snaps to the floor.
The Web workflow runs this release-export smoke test in headless Chromium before it packages the bundle.

## Important compatibility rules

- Use the supplied custom templates. Standard Godot Web templates do not enable GDExtension dynamic linking.
- Keep extension support enabled and thread support disabled for this profile.
- The supported no-thread profile always runs Box3D with one worker.
- Do not mix a side module and Godot template built with different Emscripten versions.
- Rebuild both the side module and templates when changing the Godot or Emscripten pins.
- The default build uses WebAssembly SIMD128. Use `BOX3D_DISABLE_SIMD=1 scripts/build_web.sh` only as a diagnostic fallback.

The dependency versions used for the extension and matching templates are recorded in [`dependencies.lock`](dependencies.lock).

## Embedded Web archive for worker-main hosts

The normal supported package above remains the dynamic, single-threaded route.
An embedding host that builds its own Godot Web template can instead produce
thread-capable static archives:

```bash
MAX_JOBS=4 scripts/build_web_static.sh
```

This creates one Box3D binding archive and its matching godot-cpp archive under
`bin/web/static/`. They are inputs for a host-owned Godot custom module; they are
not a complete export template and must not be mixed with another Godot API,
Box3D, or Emscripten tuple. The host is responsible for registering
`godot_box3d_main` through Godot's function-backed GDExtension loader, linking
with `dlink_enabled=no`, and validating its own `PROXY_TO_PTHREAD`,
cross-origin-isolation, physics-parity, and browser/device matrix. Keep the
ordinary dynamic/no-thread bundle as the development and rollback path.
